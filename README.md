# DYGS-Score-Java

This is a small program that I made as a spinoff of Did You Get Sniped?'s calculator. If you want to see it, the link to it is https://github.com/DidYouGetSniped/DYGS-Score. This is almost an exact copy of his program, but in Java. I used this program to test out my programming skills. If you are DYGS and you want this to be removed, I would be happy to. 

To run this program, follow the steps below:

1. Find a Java IDE with a compiler and terminal. Online ones exist.
2. Upload both DidYouGetSnipedScore.java and ReferenceScore.java files.
3. Run the DidYouGetSnipedScore.java in the IDE.
4. Run the program and calculate your score.
